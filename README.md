## Bodenmiller lab test data

In this repository, we collect any datasets that can be used for integration and unit testing purposes.

## Structure of the repository

The datasets are stored in the [datasets](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/TestData/blob/main/datasets) folder.
Each dataset should be stored in its corresponding sub-folder accompanied by a `README` file, which gives a descriptive overview of the dataset.
